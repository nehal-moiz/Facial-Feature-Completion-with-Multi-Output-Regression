# Facial-Feature-Completion-with-Multi-Output-Regression
Facial Feature Completion with Multi-Output Regression" uses machine learning to predict missing facial features. Using the Olivetti Faces dataset, it explores models like ExtraTrees and Linear Regression to reconstruct lower face halves from upper halves, improving image completion in computer vision.
